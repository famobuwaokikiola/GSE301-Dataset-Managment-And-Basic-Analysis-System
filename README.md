## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based Dataset Management and Basic Analysis System developed as part of the GSE 301 course requirements. The project demonstrates the use of basic programming techniques to manage, analyze, and interpret datasets.
It involves reading data from files, performing statistical calculations, handling errors, and saving analysis results.

## Aim and Objectives
The main aim of this project is to apply foundational Python programming concepts to data analysis tasks.

The objectives include:
- Reading data from external files
- Handling file-related and data-related errors
- Applying functions and loops for calculations
- Using conditional statements for decision-making
- Extracting unique values using sets
- Applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Saving analysis results to a file

## Programming Concepts Demonstrated
The project covers the following concepts:
- Variables and data types  
- File handling  
- Error handling  
- Functions  
- Loops  
- Conditional statements  
- Sets  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

## Files Included in the Project
- `GSE301_Dataset_Management_Project.ipynb` – Main Python notebook  
- `data.csv` – Numerical dataset  
- `categories.txt` – Categorical dataset  
- `report.txt` – Generated analysis report  

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- GitHub  

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook using Google Colab
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. View the results printed on the screen
4. Check the generated report file for saved output

## Conclusion
This project provides practical experience in applying Python programming concepts to basic data analysis problems. It serves as a foundation for more advanced studies in data science and machine learning.
